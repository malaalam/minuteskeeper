> "N2V proposes a way to leverage information of the networkâ€™s blind-spots. However, PN2V is not restricted to Gaussian noise models or Gaussian intensity predictions. More precisely, to compute the posterior distribution of a pixel, we combine (i) a general noise model that can be represented as a histogram (observation likelihood), and (ii) a distribution of possible truepixel intensities (prior), represented by a set of predicted samples."

Recently, we attempted to investigate whether the noise model of Probabilistic Noise2Void which was defined as a 256 times 256 sized-histogram could be replaced by a fewer parameter definition. One intuition behind why this may be a good idea is because firstly, The variance of the observations given the signal seems to follow a linear function of the signal:
i.e. $$ \sigma^{2}_{x|s} = a + b \times s $$ 
and secondly, The observations given the signal seem to follow a unimodal distribution. (We postulate that such a unimodal distribution can be captured through representation as a unimodal gaussian: 
i.e. $$ P(x|s) ~ N(s, \sigma_{x|s}))$$
