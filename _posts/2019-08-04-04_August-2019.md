> "N2V proposes a way to leverage information of the net-workâ€™s blind-spots. However, PN2V is not restricted to Gaussian noise models or Gaussian intensity predictions. More precisely, to compute the posterior distribution of a pixel, we combine (i) a general noise model that can be represented as a histogram (observation likelihood), and (ii) a distribution of possible truepixel intensities (prior), represented by a set of predicted samples."
