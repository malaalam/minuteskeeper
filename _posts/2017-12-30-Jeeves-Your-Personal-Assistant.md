title: Jeeves - Your Personal Assistant

For a rather long time, I have been obsessed with Recurrent Neural Networks. I understood them in a superficial, top-level way but wanted to dive in and learn more. On a few occasions, I pondered if it may be possible to combine my knowledge of audio engineering with deep recurrent neural networks in an exciting, hands-on project somehow.

Then a couple of days ago, I came across the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge) challenge which centred around converting speech to text. While there are [softwares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(software)) in the market which accomplish this, I did not see find many items of hardware devoted **only** to this scope of function. 

I envisioned a device that could create **minutes of a meeting** for a group of users firing ideas at each other. Considering that it is not uncommon that in many meetings in corporate offices, one employee jots down the minutes by hand suggests *speech to text annotation for meetings* is a function which could potentially be automated.

The fact that one doesn't hear of such devices already hints that there might be several, involved technical challenges. I quizzed a friend who has been working in the finance sector for the last three years and he was quick to point out that a good keeper of the minutes is one who can **eliminate extraneous conversations** and emphasize only the really crucial component of the meeting. So that creates a possibility of combining Natural Language Processing (to weed out irrelevant conversations) and Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (for transcribing the audio to text). Another thing the friend mentioned is how when minutes are sent out in emails, **some context is added** by the *minutes-keeper* so that a reader who wasn't present in the meeting would be able to make sense of the big picture surrounding an intense discussion. That would be an interesting challenge to tackle from the point of view of creating a solely, dedicated automated device - as this implies **content creation** and probably falls (again) in the realm of Natural Language Processing.

Upon some brainstorming with my mother (who usually has some keen insights about most things :O), I realised that another technical challenge would be **tackling multiple conversations at the same time**. I have heard that humans are quite good at [identifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect) one source of sound as distinct from the other - I wonder how good could a machine separate out two or more sources and how would these conversations be transcribed (since these occur simultaneously).

One (more) question that I don't have an answer to at this point of time is why would a separate hardware be needed for catering to this solution - since nowadays phones have quite an impressive processor anyway and can do most of the tasks. Maybe I would find an answer as I dig deeper into this project.

Think there is a definite potential from the point of view of a technical problem that must be solved. Many companies encourage sending out the minutes to all the concerned employees (just to put in writing all points which were agreed upon earlier), so if implemented well, this piece of hardware could have a large clientele. However, whether these companies would be willing to buy such a product (would such a device justify its cost by improving the productivity of a company) seems hard to answer! .

I thought I would name this project **Jeeves** in reference to the eponymous butler who makes all problems disappear!
