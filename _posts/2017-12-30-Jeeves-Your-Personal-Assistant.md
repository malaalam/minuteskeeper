title: Jeeves - Your Personal Assistant

For a rather long time, I have been obsessed with Recurrent Neural Networks. I understood them from in a superficial, top-level way but wanted to dive in and learn more. Sometimes, I used to ponder if it may be possible to combine my knowledge of audio engineering with deep recurrent neural networks somehow.

Then a couple of days ago, I re-visited this idea of transcribing your audio to text. While there are softwares in the market which accomplish this, I did not see too many items of hardware devoted **only** to this scope. 

I envisioned a device that could create *minutes of a meeting* for a group of users firing ideas at each other. Considering that even today in many meetings in corporate offices, one employee jots down the minutes by hand suggests that this is an application which could potentially be automated.

The fact that there is no such device (to my knowledge) in the market currently hints that it may not be an easy problem to solve. I quizzed a friend who has been working in the finance sector for the last three years and he was quick to point out that a good keeper of the minutes is one who can eliminate extraneous conversations from the really crucial part of the meeting. So that creates a possibility of combining Natural Language Processing (to weed out irrelevant conversations) and Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (for transcribing the audio to text). Another thing the friend mentioned is how when minutes are sent out in emails, some context is added by the user so that a reader who wasn't in the meeting can make sense of the big picture surrounding an intense discussion. That would be an interesting challenge to tackle from the point of view of creating a solely dedicated device - as this challenge implies **content creation** and probbaly falls again in the realm of Natural Language Processing.

Upon some brainstorming with my mother (who usually has some keen insights about most things :O), I realised that another technological challenge that would be faced with such a device is tackling multiple conversations at the same time. I have heard that humans are quite good at filtering one source of soound from the other - wonder how good could a machine separate out two or more sources and how would these conversations be transcribed.

One question that I don't have an answer to at this point of time is why would a separate hardware be needed for this solution - since nowadays phones have quite an impressive processor anyway and can do most of the tasks. I have an inkling that I would find an answer as I get deeper into this project.

Think there is a definite potential for this product since companies encourage sending out the minutes to all the concerned employees (just to put in writing all points which were agreed upon earlier). However, whether they would be willing to buy such a product or if such a device would justify its cost in improving the productivity of a company seems a hard question to answer! Also considering that I know zilch about recurrent neural networks and implementation on hardware means that I would have to sweat it out. But I would probably learn a lot - and that is key at the end of the day.

I thought I would name this project **Jeeves** in reference to the eponymous butler who makes all problems disappear!
