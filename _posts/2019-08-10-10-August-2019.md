(From [Pischulin et al, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06645))
> "Key challenges inherent to multi person pose estimation are the partial visibility of some people, significant overlapof bounding box regions of people, and the a-priori unknownnumber of people in an image.  The problem thus is to in-fer the number of persons, assign part detections to personinstances while respecting geometric and appearance con-straints. Most strategies use a two-stage inference process to first detect and then independently estimateposes. This is unsuited for cases when people are in close proximity since they permit simulataneous assignment of the same body-part candidates to multiple people hypotheses."
