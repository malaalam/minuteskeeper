> "Like  autoencoders,  context  encoders  are  trained  in  acompletely unsupervised manner.  Our results demonstratethat in order to succeed at this task, a model needs to bothunderstand the content of an image,  as well as produce aplausible hypothesis for the missing parts.  This task, how-ever, is inherently multi-modal as there are multiple waysto fill the missing region while also maintaining coherencewith the given context. We decouple this burden in our lossfunction by jointly training our context encoders to mini-mize both a reconstruction loss and an adversarial loss. Thereconstruction (L2) loss captures the overall structure of themissing region in relation to the context, while the the adversarial loss has the effect of picking a particular modefrom the distribution."
