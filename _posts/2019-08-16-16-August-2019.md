Recently, I  came across some noisy images which were generated using a known model, but we were missing the complete set of parameters. I thought it would be a cool exercise to try estimating these using Gradient Search in PyTorch. To this end, I implemented a mini-batch gradient version for a simple, mock-noise model [here](https://github.com/malaalam/PyTorchExperiments/blob/master/16August2019/estimateMockNoiseParameters.ipynb). 

Think for this model to succeed on the SIM-SIM script, I should isolate parameters which allow for multiple solutions. For example, in the equation below, the model can learn either (10, 2, 3) or (5, 4, 6), and such scenarios should be avoided.

$$
I2= 10 * (2*I+3) = 5*(4*I+6)
$$
