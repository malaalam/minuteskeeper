> "Calcium  is  a  universal  second  messenger  regulating  essential cellular   signaling   events   in   many   tissues   and   organisms. In neurons, action potentials (APs) trigger large and rapid changes in cytoplasmic-free calcium concentration. Similarly, activation of  glutamate  receptors  during  synaptic  transmission  produces [Ca2+]  transients  in  dendritic  spines."


Recently, I came into possession, a dataset from the [Keller Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/keller-lab) showing the volumetric evolution of $$Ca^{2+}$$ signal in an embryo of *C. elegans*. The microscope which was used to acquire the images contained two cameras placed at 180 degrees in relation with each other, so in effect, we acquired two volumetric images for each time point. 

Interestingly, since half of the axial length of the embryo is closer to one camera than the other, one can see that the first half of the the first volumetric stack is more in focus for the first camera (referred to as *CM02*) and the second half of the second volumetric stack is more in focus for the second camera (referred to as *CM03*).

I wonder whether the blurring arises as a consequence of the axial properties of the point spread function, on account of spherical aberration or because of scattering through the physical specimen?! Also, are there visual differences between the blur caused by these different mechanisms?

## Step One

Prior to beginning any training regime, I thought it would be a good idea to have both the images available in the same orientation (and not as mirror images, as can be seen in Figure One). To enable this, I manually picked 5-10 similar looking features from both images and performed an affine transform on the image acquired from CM02 (this would be equivalent to performing a mirroring operation on the image acquired from CM02), using java [code](https://github.com/malaalam/MonitorCalciumSignals/blob/f31fc0bac05e99ebaeb0ff76c0d185f589392fef/src/main/java/bdv/ui/panel/uicomponents/ProcessTimeFrame/RegisterImagesPanel.java#L246) as follows:

```java
RealRandomAccessible<UnsignedShortType> interpolated = Views.interpolate(Views.extendZero(image), new NLinearInterpolatorFactory<>());
RealRandomAccessible<UnsignedShortType> transformed = RealViews.affine(interpolated, affineTransform3D);
RandomAccessibleInterval<UnsignedShortType> rai = Views.interval(Views.raster(transformed), image);
```

## Step Two


Since denoising techniques such as CARE require pixel-wise correct registration, next I employed **simpleITK** to obtain the highest mutual information between the two images. An example notebook is available [here](https://github.com/malaalam/MonitorCalciumSignals/blob/master/01_Notebooks/03Aug2019/60_Registration_Introduction.ipynb). The iterator for most pair of images converges to a mutual information close to **-0.3**. Not totallly what this value suggests : should try to implement my own mutual information registor and investigate this value.


## Step Three 

### CARE

We noticed that the slices in the middle of each volumetric stack (i.e. z = 30 to 40) are blurry in images acquired from both the cameras. We exclude those and also the ones on the extremities of each stack (z = 1 to 5 and z = 65 to 70) to avoid any registration artifacts during the training phase. During the process of preparing the [training](https://github.com/malaalam/MonitorCalciumSignals/blob/master/01_Notebooks/03Aug2019/01_training_care_kellerlab_T390-399-WithNormalization-pixelwiseregisteredData.ipynb) and [prediction](https://github.com/malaalam/MonitorCalciumSignals/blob/master/01_Notebooks/03Aug2019/02_prediction_care_kellerlab_T390-399-WithNormalization-pixelwiseregisteredData.ipynb) notebooks, I realised the importance of using copy.deepcopy() for copying lists (instead of using an assignment operation, which still retains a reference to the original list).
