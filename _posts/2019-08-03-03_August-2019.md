Recently, I came into possession, a dataset from the Keller Lab showing the volumetric evolution of $$Ca^{2+}$$ signal in an embryo of C. elegans. The microscope which was used to acquire the images contained two cameras placed at 180 degrees in relation with each other, so in effect, we acquired two volumetric images for each time point.

Interestingly, since half of the axial length of the embryo is closer to one camera than the other, one can see that the first half of the the first volumetric stack is more in focus for the first camera (referred to as CM02) and the second half of the second volumetric stack is more in focus for the second camera (referred to as CM03).

I thought that I would begin by looking at a subset of the time points (T390 to T399) and test the following denoising approaches:

* Noise2Void (Two Channels)
* Noise2Void (3-D, One Channel)
* CARE (2-D)
* Noise2Noise
