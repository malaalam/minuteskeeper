This blog arose from a desire to document my progress in deep learning and genomics - in which I wish to specialize. Hopefully in the process of reading this content, you would have some ideas that you might like to share and it may inspire me anew!

I would try to keep the information pertinent to the above mentioned two topics only. To begin with, I would like to introduce a new, scientific paper in each post but that format may change with time.

Thanks for being here!
