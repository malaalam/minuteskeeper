For a rather long time, I have been obsessed with Recurrent Neural Networks. I understood them from a very superficial, top-level but wanted to dive in and implement them on a piece of hardware.

Then a couple of days ago, I came across this idea of transcribing your audio. While there are softwares in the market which accomplish that, I did not see too many hardware items devoted only to this task. And hence I thought this might be an interesting project to work upon.

Think I envision a device that can create minutes of a meeting for a group of users. Considering that many meetings in corporate settings require one employee to jot down the main points of the meeting support the idea that this device can be useful.

The fact that there is no such device in the market currently gives a hint of the lurking problems. I quizzed a friend who has been working in the finance sector for the last three years and he was quick to point that a good keepr of the minutes is one who can eliminate extraneous conversations from the really crucial part of the meeting. So that creates a setting of Natural Language Processing (to weed out irrelevant conversations) meeting RNN (for transcribing the audio to text). Another thing he mentioned is how when minutes are sent out in emails, some context is added by the user so that a reader who wasn't in the meeting can make sense of the bigger picture. That would be an interesting challenge to tackle - as that spells content creation.

Upon further brainstorming with my mother, I realised that other problems could be tackling multiple conversations at the same time. I have heard that humans are quite good at filtering one source of soound from the other - wonder how good a machine can separate out two or more sources and how are these conversations transcribed.

One question that one could ask is why is a separate hardware needed for this solution - since nowadays phones have quite an impressive processor, memory and speed. That is a question I have no answer to, at the moment. And I think I will find an answer as I get deeper into this project.

Think there is definite potential for this product since so many corporates require the minutes to be sent out to the concerned employees (just to put to writing the points which were agreed upon) but it is a hard technological problem! Also considering that I know zilch about recurrent neural networks and implementation on hardware means that I would have to really sweat it out.
