I graduated in ME from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) and then completed a masters in Applied Mechanics from the [Chalmers University](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx). From 2014 up till 2017, I was working in the field of acoustics in the automotive industry. During this period, I was writing scripts in Python and MATLAB, building graphical interfaces and playing with differential equations. 

### More Information

For the last few months, I have turned my attention to genomics and machine learning. Part of the reason for this move is that I am smitten by Deep Learning and its capability to automate multiple areas of work. Genomics with its *bigness* and *sparsity* of data (depending on where the DNA has come from) presents unique challenges for the application of Deep Learning. These two domains appear complimentary and would allow me to bounce back and forth between the WHAT and the HOW of things, which is a good, holistic way to work on an investigative project, according to me.

Currently, I focus on developing methods around Single Cell RNA -Sequencing, and am enamored by evolutionary and paleogenomics in my free time. I thought I would build this blog to document my progress in all of these - maybe you find some posts interesting and wish to leave me some feedback. That would be amazing! :)

Thanks for stopping by.
